This is my first react app. Representing online store for living walls.

The backend is practice server from Softuni.(If you stop the server all data you wrote will be deleted).
The frontend is a react code.

Start the app:

1. You have to enter the directory of server and start the server with command: node server.js
2. You have to enter the directory of client and install packajes with command:  npm i
3. After that on the same directoy (directory of client) you have to start the client with command: npm start

Usage:

The app allows you to see the product of moss and plant.
1. If you don't have registration ou can only see the ads (you can not add ads and comment other ads).
2. You can register user and after that you can login/logout in your own profile.
3. If you login you can add ads and also you can comment ads of other users.
4. If you are creator of ads you can edit and delete you own ads.

The app have forms who are validated. So if you don't fill in all field, the button will be disabled.
If you fill in with wrong data you will see notice which will show you kind of error.
